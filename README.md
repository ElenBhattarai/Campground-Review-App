# Yelp Camp

This is a campground review webapp I created after I did the course called "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele.<br>

I deployed the app using Heroku. You can visit the webapp live through the link here: https://tranquil-citadel-24717.herokuapp.com/<br>

Features:<br>
• Webapp supports user signup/ login, posting new campgrounds, posting reviews, comments, and editing/deleting previous submissions.<br>
•	I used MapBox API to add a cluster map in the homepage showing locations of all the campgrounds in the world entered in the website’s database.<br>
